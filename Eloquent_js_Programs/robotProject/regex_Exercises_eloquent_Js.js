Regexp golf 
Code golf is a term used for the game of 
trying to express a particular program in 
as few characters as possible. Similarly, 
regexp golf is the practice of writing as
tiny a regular expression as possible to 
match a given pattern, and only that 
pattern. For each of the following items,
write a regular expression to test whether 
any of the given substrings occur in a 
string. The regular expression should 
match only strings containing one of 
the substrings described. Do not worry 
about word boundaries unless explicitly 
mentioned. When your expression works, 
see whether you can make it any smaller. 
1. car and cat 
2. pop and prop 
3. ferret, ferry, and ferrari 
4. Any word ending in ious 
5. A white space character followed by a 
period, comma, colon, or semicolon 
6. A word longer than six letters 
7. A word without the letter e (or E)

Quoting style 

Imagine you have written a story and used 
single quotation marks throughout to mark 
pieces of dialogue. Now you want to replace 
all the dialogue quotes with double quotes, 
while keeping the single quotes used in 
contractions like arenâ€™t. Think of a pattern
that distinguishes these two kinds of quote 
usage and craft a call to the replace method 
that does the proper replacement.
